# Changelog

All notable changes to NodePulse are documented here.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-07-16
### Changed
- Added repository metadata files (`repository.json` and `hacs.json`) to allow direct installation from the GitHub repository via the Home Assistant Add-on Store and HACS.
- Polished the addon description and generated a custom icon/logo for a professional appearance in the Home Assistant UI.
- Rewrote the installation documentation to reflect the new GitHub installation paths.
- Synchronized `CHANGELOG.md` and `DOCS.md` into the `nodepulse-addon/` directory so they render correctly in the Home Assistant Add-on Store tabs.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-07-16
### Fixed
- Fixed an `ImportError` preventing integration load on HA 2024.5+ by replacing the deprecated `TEMP_CELSIUS` and `SIGNAL_STRENGTH_DECIBELS` constants.
- Resolved an `Integration error: 'bool' object can't be awaited` exception when clicking "Track in HA" on newer HA versions.
- Fixed a bug where partial traceroutes failed to render on the map if an intermediate hop lacked a GPS fix.
- Map links now clean up correctly and won't visually persist after they've been cleared.
- Fixed an issue where the HA integration would hang for 10 seconds per incorrect local DNS slug before finding the addon.

### Changed
- The Web UI Settings tab now dynamically displays the live config including connection status, logging, and integration keys instead of static text.
- Device names in the Home Assistant integration now use the node's long/short name instead of just the raw hex ID.
- Promoted the first successfully resolving HA addon DNS slug to avoid repeatedly testing unreachable ones in every poll.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **Integration Connection Failure:** Relaxed the setup validation in `config_flow.py`. The integration now successfully configures as long as the addon is reachable, no longer blocking setup if the Meshtastic radio is temporarily offline.
- **Silent Logger Crashes:** Fixed a `TypeError` bug across the custom integration (in `__init__.py`, `config_flow.py`, `sensor.py`, and `device_tracker.py`) caused by passing dictionaries to `logger.info`, which swallowed entity registration errors.
- **Data Race in Traceroutes:** Resolved a threading race condition where traceroute results were saved to disk without acquiring the shared nodes lock.
- **Misleading Log Noise:** First-boot connection attempts no longer emit a `WARNING` before actually trying to connect.
- **UI Message Deduplication:** Fixed a bug where identically-worded outbound messages sent minutes apart were aggressively suppressed; the deduplication window is now correctly limited to 3 seconds.
- **Map Popup `null` Values:** Guarded the HTML escaper in the map UI so missing node fields no longer display the literal string "null".
- **Misleading Setup Instructions:** Updated `strings.json` to correctly suggest the auto-discovered Supervisor addon host rather than `localhost`, preventing user confusion.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **Traceroutes were silently dropped.** `_capture_traceroute` referenced
  `target_id` before it was assigned, raising `UnboundLocalError` that the
  defensive `except` swallowed. Traceroute routes are now captured and shown
  on the map. (connection.py)
- **Captured GPS fixes lost on every poll.** `_get_nodes_sync` restored the
  previously captured latitude/longitude/altitude *after* overwriting them with
  the library's (often `None`) raw values. Position fixes from "Req. Position"
  now persist across polls. (connection.py)
- **Tracked HA entities vanished after a reload.** Per-node discovery used a
  module-level `registered_node_ids` set that survived `async_unload_entry`, so
  toggling "Track in HA" (which triggers a config reload) re-skipped already
  seen nodes and removed their entities. Bookkeeping now lives on the
  coordinator (per config entry) and resets on setup. (coordinator.py,
  sensor.py, device_tracker.py)
- **`persist_tracked_nodes` not awaited** — the `async_update_entry` coroutine
  was fire-and-forget; now awaited so the reload fires reliably. (coordinator.py)
- **Node-ID key mismatch.** Normalized `interface.nodes` keys (int or hex) to
  the canonical `!xxxxxxxx` form so traceroute/position merges and Web UI
  lookups stay consistent across meshtastic library versions. (connection.py)
- **Duplicate sent-message bubbles.** Meshtastic echoes our own DMs back,
  creating a second bubble; `storeMessage` now dedupes outgoing messages by
  text within a thread. (app.js)
- **Only the Primary channel was listed.** `_get_channels_sync` now reads the
  full `localConfig.channel_settings` list (filtered for configured channels)
  instead of the partial `interface.channels`. All your channels now appear in
  the channel selector. (connection.py)
- **Messaging card squashed.** The compose row crammed recipient + channel
  selector + textarea + send into one 360px row. Restructured into two rows
  (recipient + channel on top, textarea + send below) so the message list keeps
  its space. (index.html, main.css)

## [0.2.6] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Per-node "Track in HA" toggle in the Web UI that creates/removes HA entities
  via the integration's local relay endpoints.
- Persistent message and traceroute storage across addon restarts.
- Conversation tabs (channels + DMs) with unread badges, per-thread history,
  and send status (sending/sent/failed + retry).
- Map overlay toggles: self links, peer proximity, traceroute routes, and
  node names.
